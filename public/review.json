    "text":"You cannot get an appointment to fix your car. It takes over a month just to make an appointment. If you have something wrong with your tire and you live in Tampa, Fl. be prepared for them to: 1. Not have a tire available 2. Not have a car for you to drive when that tire is not available 3. Charge you $82 to patch it (if possible) 4. Wait over 2 hours at the service center to change the tire 5. Have staff go on lunch breaks while you are waiting extending your wait time even longer without informing you 6. Charge you $400 for a tire that they are not sure if you need?? How can Tesla sell cars that can only be serviced by a Tesla dealer but then not have staff to complete the service? I will be trading in the Tesla for a more luxury electric car. One that actually provides customer service!!"

Much more comfortable than my Model S, it's not quite as quick or as smooth, but the added ease of entering and exiting the vehicle is worth it. I'm totally pleased but looking forward to my next gen Model X when Tesla perfects the 4680 battery.    "
